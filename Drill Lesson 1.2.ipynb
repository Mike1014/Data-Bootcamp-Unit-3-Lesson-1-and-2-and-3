We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?"

    "First I would create a new dataframe (X) for the four categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. And then, I would create an array (Y) that separates the people who will pay their bills on time. With all these data, I can use KNN to predict the likeliness of someone paying their bills on time using the information from the four categories. In order to have an accurate prediction, I need to normalize the data and weights the distance in between the data points. "
